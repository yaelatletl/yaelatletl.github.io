## About the project

This addon is based on the method presented in this twitter thread, as well as in this blog post. 

## How does it work?
This is a shader for 3d sprites that use Y alignment. The effect works better for smoke, as this presents difference on direction and absorpion of light. 


## How does it look?

Various angles of a particle system and two omni lights.
